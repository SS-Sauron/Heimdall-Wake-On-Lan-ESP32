<div align="center">

A compact **ESP32** firmware that stands silent watch on your MQTT broker, intercepts wake commands, and broadcasts **Wake-on-LAN magic packets** to sleeping machines on your local network.

Configure it once through the built-in captive portal — then forget it exists. Until you need it.

## ✦ What It Does

```
  [ MQTT Broker ] ──── TLS ────► [ Heimdall / ESP32 ] ──── UDP ────► [ Sleeping PC ]
                                         👁
                                    Always Watching
```

You send a command. Heimdall wakes your machine. That's it.

## ✦ Features

| | Feature |
|---|---|
| 🌐 | **Captive Portal Provisioning** — Connect, configure, done. Full DNS redirect on iOS, Android & Windows |
| 🔐 | **Two Build Profiles** — STANDARD for simplicity, HARDENED for OPSEC-grade deployments |
| 🔑 | **TOTP Authentication** — RFC 6238 compliant. Every wake command requires a valid one-time code |
| 🕵️ | **Identity Obfuscation** — MAC spoofing, fake consumer-device hostname, HMAC-derived opaque MQTT topics |
| 📡 | **Dynamic Broadcast** — Computes the correct broadcast address at runtime. Works on any subnet |
| 🔄 | **OTA Updates** — Pull firmware over HTTPS with automatic rollback on failure |
| 🛡️ | **Self-Healing** — Crash loop detection, wrong-credential recovery, WiFi timeout escape hatch |
| 🏷️ | **Custom Hostname** — Set your own device name, synced to DHCP, mDNS, and NetBIOS |

## ✦ Hardware

- **ESP32** (classic) development board
- Connected to your local WiFi network
- Access to an MQTT broker (local or cloud, port 1883 or 8883 TLS)

That's it. No extra components required.

---

## ✦ Quick Start

**1. Flash the firmware**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SS-Sauron/Heimdall.git
cd Heimdall
idf.py build flash monitor
```

**2. Connect to the portal**

On first boot, Heimdall creates a WiFi access point. Connect to it — your device will automatically open the configuration page. Enter your WiFi and MQTT broker credentials.

<div align="center">
  <img src="resources/Portal.png" alt="Heimdall Captive Portal Configuration" width="400"/>
</div>

After saving, the device reboots into relay mode. Use the successful startup log below to confirm WiFi, TLS, and MQTT are all working.

**3. Send a wake command**

Publish a payload to Heimdall's command topic:
```text
AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
```

Your machine wakes up.

---

## ✦ First Provisioning Boot

```console
I (645) main: Not provisioned — starting captive portal
I (660) portal: Portal AP  SSID: NETGEAR-XXXXXX
I (663) portal: Portal AP  PASS: <HIDDEN>  (write this on a label)
I (1109) portal: SoftAP started  SSID: NETGEAR-XXXXXX  Auth: WPA2  DHCP opt-114: http://192.168.4.1/
I (1117) dns_server: Listening on UDP port 53 — redirect → 192.168.4.1
I (1122) dns_server: Started — redirecting all A queries to 192.168.4.1
I (1135) portal: HTTP server ready on port 80
I (1135) portal: Portal ready — waiting for credentials
I (10709) esp_netif_lwip: DHCP server assigned IP to a client, IP is: 192.168.4.2
I (123605) portal: Stripped scheme prefix from broker URL: 'https://xxx.eu.hivemq.cloud' → 'xxx.eu.hivemq.cloud'
I (123618) storage: Credentials saved successfully
I (123619) storage: Hostname saved: test-relay-name
I (137113) portal: Credentials saved — rebooting into relay mode
```

---

## ✦ Successful Relay Startup

After provisioning valid WiFi and MQTT credentials, the next reboot should move past the portal and into relay mode. The important success markers are: WiFi gets an IP address, TLS validates the broker certificate, MQTT connects, and the command topic subscription is confirmed.

<div align="center">
  <img src="resources/relay-start.jpeg" alt="Heimdall relay startup confirmation screen" width="360"/>
</div>

```console
I (646) identity: Hostname loaded from NVS: test-relay
I (649) main: Credentials found — starting relay
I (2875) wifi_sta: Got IP: 192.168.1.11
I (2876) main: WiFi connected
I (2879) main: Starting MQTT relay
I (2881) opsec: Command  topic: wol/<device-mac>
I (2885) opsec: Response topic: wol/<device-mac>/r
I (2893) mqtt_relay: Connecting to MQTT broker: mqtts://<cluster>.hivemq.cloud:8883
I (2900) mqtt_relay: MQTT credential lengths: username=6 password=14
I (2906) mqtt_relay: TLS hostname verification/SNI: enabled via broker URI hostname
I (2917) mqtt_relay: MQTT client started — relay is active
I (3702) esp-x509-crt-bundle: Certificate validated
I (4895) mqtt_relay: MQTT connected — subscribing to: wol/<device-mac>
I (5002) mqtt_relay: Subscription confirmed (msg_id=22951)
```

If the log reaches `MQTT connected` and `Subscription confirmed`, Heimdall is online and waiting for wake commands on the command topic shown above.

## ✦ Response Payload

After dispatching a magic packet, Heimdall publishes a confirmation to the response topic:

```json
{
  "mac": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",
  "status": "sent",
  "free_heap": 187432,
  "uptime_s": 3672
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `mac` | The target MAC address that the Wake-on-LAN magic packet was dispatched to. |
| `status` | Confirmation that the packet was successfully broadcast to the local network. |
| `free_heap` | The available RAM on the ESP32 in bytes. Useful for monitoring device health. |
| `uptime_s` | Total time the ESP32 has been continuously running in seconds since the last reboot. |
