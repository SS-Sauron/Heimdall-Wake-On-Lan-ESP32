<div align="center">

A compact **ESP32** firmware that stands silent watch on your MQTT broker, intercepts wake commands, and broadcasts **Wake-on-LAN magic packets** to sleeping machines on your local network.

Configure it once through the built-in captive portal — then forget it exists. Until you need it.

## ✦ What It Does

```text
  [ MQTT Broker ] ──── TLS ────► [ Heimdall / ESP32 ] ──── UDP ────► [ Target PC ]
        │                                👁                                ▲
        │                           Always Watching                        │

                               (Sleep Listener)
```

Heimdall is a complete remote power management and network security tool built for the ESP32. Out of the box, it provides:
- **Wake-on-LAN**: Broadcasts magic packets to wake sleeping PCs across any local subnet.
- **Remote PC Sleep**: Includes a companion listener script to securely put your PC back to sleep via MQTT.
- **GPIO Control**: Allows you to remotely toggle physical relays or indicators wired to the ESP32.
- **Stealth & OPSEC**: Can be configured to operate completely invisibly with MAC spoofing, fake hostnames, HMAC-derived MQTT topics, and TOTP authentication to prevent unauthorized network control.

</div>

---

## ✦ Hardware

- **ESP32** (classic) development board
- Connected to your local WiFi network
- Access to an MQTT broker (local or cloud, port 1883 or 8883 TLS)
- *(Optional)* The ESP32's built-in LED is used for visual status feedback by default (can be disabled for stealth)

That's it. No extra components required.

---

## ✦ Web Flasher (No IDE Required)

The easiest way to install Heimdall is directly from your browser using the official Web Flasher. You don't need to install any development tools or compile anything from source.

**[🚀 Launch the Heimdall Web Flasher](https://ss-sauron.github.io/Heimdall-Wake-On-Lan-ESP32/)**

1. Connect your ESP32 to your computer via USB.
2. Open the link above in a supported browser (Chrome, Edge, or Opera).
3. Choose your desired build profile (**Standard**, **Hardened (Full)**, or **Hardened Stealth**) and click **Connect**.
4. Select the COM port for your ESP32.
5. Click **Install Heimdall** and wait for the flash to complete.

Once flashed, skip down to **Step 4** in the Quick Start below to connect to the captive portal and provision your credentials.

---

## ✦ Prerequisites (Building from Source)

Before building, make sure the ESP-IDF environment is installed and exported in your shell.

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/) | v6.0.1 | Use the official installer or `install.sh` flow |
| Python | 3.8+ | Installed by the ESP-IDF tools setup |
| Xtensa ESP32 toolchain | ESP-IDF managed | Installed by `install.sh` / the ESP-IDF installer |
| IDF Component Manager | ESP-IDF bundled | Resolves managed components during build |

Check the active environment with:

```bash
idf.py --version
```

> [!NOTE]
> **IDE Code Intelligence:** A `.clangd` configuration file is included in the repository root. It strips Xtensa GCC-specific flags (`-mlongcalls`, `-fstrict-volatile-bitfields`, etc.) that the IDE's clangd language server does not understand. Without it your IDE may show false-positive errors for standard headers like `string.h`. The firmware build via `idf.py` is completely unaffected.

---

## ✦ Quick Start (Building from Source)

**1. Clone the project**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SS-Sauron/Heimdall.git
cd Heimdall
idf.py set-target esp32
```

**2. Select a build profile (optional)**

The default profile is STANDARD. To switch to HARDENED or build Stealth from source, see [Build Profiles](docs/build_profiles.md). Quick override before building:

```bash
idf.py menuconfig
```

Navigate to **WoL Relay → Build Profile**, choose the profile, save, and exit.

For Hardened or Stealth without menuconfig:

```bash
# Hardened (full)
SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS="sdkconfig.defaults;sdkconfig.hardened" idf.py build

# Hardened Stealth
SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS="sdkconfig.defaults;sdkconfig.hardened;sdkconfig.hardened.stealth" idf.py build
```

**3. Build, flash, and monitor**

```bash
idf.py build flash monitor
```

**4. Connect to the portal**

On first boot, Heimdall creates a WPA2-protected WiFi access point. The SSID and permanent portal password are printed to the serial monitor when serial provisioning output is enabled. Connect from your phone or laptop — the configuration page opens automatically on iOS, Android, and Windows.

<div align="center">
  <img src="resources/Portal.png" alt="Heimdall Captive Portal Configuration" width="400"/>
</div>

After saving, the device reboots into relay mode. Use the successful startup log below to confirm WiFi, TLS, and MQTT are all working.

**5. Send a wake command**

Publish the target machine's MAC address as a plain-text payload to Heimdall's command topic:

```text
AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
```

*(If you enabled Ping Feedback, you can optionally include the target IP. See **Usage & Operation** for payload formats).*

Your machine wakes up.

Publish a different target MAC to the same command topic to wake a different WoL-capable device on the same LAN. Heimdall does not store a single target PC MAC; the payload selects the target for each command.

> See the **[Usage & Operation](#-usage--operation)** section below for details on how to use the provided bash scripts to automate this, and how to find your specific command topic.

---

## ✦ MQTT Broker

Heimdall works with hosted or local MQTT brokers. Use port `8883` for MQTT over TLS, or port `1883` for plain MQTT on a trusted local network.

Example hosted brokers include [HiveMQ Cloud](https://www.hivemq.com/mqtt-cloud-broker/) and [Adafruit IO](https://io.adafruit.com). These are examples only; any compatible MQTT broker should work.

In the portal, enter the broker hostname such as:

```text
example-cluster.s1.eu.hivemq.cloud
```

Do not include credentials, paths, or real secrets in the broker field. Scheme prefixes such as `mqtts://`, `mqtt://`, `https://`, and `tcp://` are accepted but stripped before storage.

---

## ✦ First Provisioning Boot

```console
I (645) main: Not provisioned — starting captive portal
I (646) main: Portal password: <HIDDEN>  (permanent — same after every reset)
I (660) portal: Portal AP  SSID: NETGEAR-XXXXXX
I (663) portal: Portal AP  Auth: WPA2
I (1109) portal: SoftAP started  SSID: NETGEAR-XXXXXX  Auth: WPA2  DHCP opt-114: http://192.168.4.1/
I (1117) dns_server: Listening on UDP port 53 — redirect → 192.168.4.1
I (1122) dns_server: Started — redirecting all A queries to 192.168.4.1
I (1135) portal: HTTP server ready on port 80
I (1135) portal: Portal ready — waiting for credentials
I (10709) esp_netif_lwip: DHCP server assigned IP to a client, IP is: 192.168.4.2
I (123605) portal: Stripped scheme prefix from broker URL: 'https://xxx.eu.hivemq.cloud' → 'xxx.eu.hivemq.cloud'
I (123618) storage: Credentials saved successfully
I (123619) storage: Hostname saved: test-relay-name
I (137113) portal: Credentials saved — rebooting into relay mode
```

---

## ✦ Successful Relay Startup

After provisioning valid WiFi and MQTT credentials, the next reboot should move past the portal and into relay mode. The important success markers are: WiFi gets an IP address, TLS validates the broker certificate, MQTT connects, and the command topic subscription is confirmed.

<div align="center">
  <img src="resources/relay-start.jpeg" alt="Heimdall relay startup confirmation screen" width="360"/>
</div>

```console
I (646) identity: Hostname loaded from NVS: test-relay
I (649) main: Credentials found — starting relay
I (2875) wifi_sta: Got IP: <local-ip>
I (2876) main: WiFi connected
I (2879) main: Starting MQTT relay
I (2881) opsec: Command  topic: wol/<device-mac>
I (2885) opsec: Status   topic: wol/<device-mac>/s
I (2887) opsec: Log      topic: wol/<device-mac>/l
I (2893) mqtt_relay: Connecting to MQTT broker: mqtts://<cluster>.hivemq.cloud:8883
I (2900) mqtt_relay: MQTT credential lengths: username=<len> password=<len>
I (2906) mqtt_relay: TLS hostname verification/SNI: enabled via broker URI hostname
I (2917) mqtt_relay: MQTT client started — relay is active
I (3702) esp-x509-crt-bundle: Certificate validated
I (4895) mqtt_relay: MQTT connected — subscribing to: wol/<device-mac>
I (5002) mqtt_relay: Subscription confirmed (msg_id=22951)
```

If the log reaches `MQTT connected` and `Subscription confirmed`, Heimdall is online and waiting for wake commands on the command topic shown above.

> [!NOTE]
> For detailed configuration, security hardening, TOTP setup, OTA instructions, and future feature planning — see the [`/docs`](docs/) folder and [roadmap](docs/heimdall_feature_roadmap.md).

---

## ✦ Usage & Operation

Once Heimdall is successfully provisioned and connected to your MQTT broker, you can start sending wake commands.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Don't mix up your MAC addresses!**
> - **Topic MAC:** The MAC address of the *Heimdall ESP32 device*. This defines *where* the command is sent.
> - **Payload MAC:** The MAC address of the *Sleeping PC* you want to wake. This defines *what* is woken up.

---

### ✦ Finding Your Command Topic

The topics Heimdall subscribes and publishes to depend on the selected build profile. Responses are split into a **Status** topic (`/s`) for retained machine-readable state, and a **Log** topic (`/l`) for unretained human-readable diagnostics.

**STANDARD build**

```text
Command:  wol/<device-mac>
Status:   wol/<device-mac>/s
Log:      wol/<device-mac>/l
```

`<device-mac>` is the ESP32 station MAC printed in the serial monitor.

**HARDENED build**

```text
Command:  <16-character-hmac-topic>
Status:   <16-character-hmac-topic-base>/s
Log:      <16-character-hmac-topic-base>/l
```

HARDENED topics are opaque strings derived from the device MAC and a secret generated during provisioning. They are printed to the serial monitor during relay startup.

---

### ✦ Putting a PC to Sleep

Heimdall includes a cross-platform companion script (`sleep_listener.py` and `sleep_listener.exe`) that can run silently on your target PC. When it receives a specific sleep command via your MQTT broker, it triggers the OS to sleep (or suspend) immediately.

For full setup instructions, see the **[PC Sleep Listener Guide](docs/pc_sleep_listener.md)**.

---

### ✦ Using the Trigger Scripts

The repository includes ready-to-use Bash scripts that format the MQTT payload and handle the `mosquitto_pub` command for you.

**Prerequisites:** You must have `mosquitto-clients` installed (and `oathtool` if using the hardened script).

**STANDARD Script Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/wake_standard.sh <broker> <port> <topic> <target-mac> [user] [pass]
```
*Example:* `./scripts/wake_standard.sh mqtt.example.com 8883 "wol/AA:BB:CC:11:22:33" 99:88:77:66:55:44`

**HARDENED Script Usage (with TOTP):**
```bash
./scripts/wake_hardened.sh <broker> <port> <topic> <target-mac> <totp-secret> [user] [pass]
```
*Example:* `./scripts/wake_hardened.sh mqtt.example.com 8883 "a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8" 99:88:77:66:55:44 "JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP"`

---

### ✦ Ping Feedback (Optional)

If your firmware is compiled with `CONFIG_WOL_PING_FEEDBACK=y`, you can include the target PC's IP address in your command. Heimdall will ping the machine and publish an alert when it successfully boots up, or if it times out.

> [!NOTE]
> Ping feedback is **disabled** in the **Hardened Stealth** preset (`CONFIG_WOL_PING_FEEDBACK=n`). No ICMP is sent to the target PC after a wake command.

**Standard Build (JSON):**
Send a JSON payload instead of plain text:
```json
{"mac":"AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF", "ip":"192.168.1.100"}
```

**Hardened Build (String):**
Append the IP address as a 4th segment after the MAC and TOTP:
```text
AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF:123456:192.168.1.100
```

---

### ✦ Response Payload

> [!NOTE]
> The MQTT response channel is **disabled** in the **Hardened Stealth** preset (`CONFIG_WOL_RESPONSE_CHANNEL=n`). No confirmation, no `/l` heartbeats, and no retained `online`/`offline` presence are published. This is by design — stealth reduces MQTT observability.

After dispatching a magic packet (Standard and Hardened Full builds), Heimdall publishes a confirmation to the **Status** topic (`/s`):

```json
{
  "mac": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",
  "status": "sent"
}
```

System diagnostics (like uptime and free heap) are published periodically and upon wake commands to the **Log** topic (`/l`):

```json
{
  "free_heap": 187432,
  "uptime_s": 3672
}
```

If Ping Feedback was requested, you will receive a *second* message on the **Status** topic once the machine boots (or times out):

```json
{
  "mac": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",
  "status": "awake",
  "boot_time_s": 14
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `mac` | The target MAC address that the Wake-on-LAN magic packet was dispatched to. |
| `status` | `sent` (WoL broadcasted), `awake` (PC responded to ping), or `timeout` (ping failed). |
| `boot_time_s` | Time elapsed in seconds between the WoL broadcast and the first successful ping reply. |
| `free_heap` | (Log topic only) The available RAM on the ESP32 in bytes. Useful for monitoring device health. |
| `uptime_s` | (Log topic only) Total time the ESP32 has been continuously running in seconds since the last reboot. |

---

### ✦ GPIO Output Control

If your firmware is compiled with `CONFIG_WOL_GPIO_COMMANDS=y`, you can control specific GPIO pins on the ESP32 by publishing a JSON payload to the main command topic.

Only pins listed in `CONFIG_WOL_GPIO_ALLOWED_PINS` can be controlled.

> [!NOTE]
> GPIO commands are **disabled** in the **Hardened Stealth** preset (`CONFIG_WOL_GPIO_COMMANDS=n`).

**Standard Build (JSON):**
```json
{"action":"gpio", "pin":4, "level":1}
```

**Hardened Build (JSON with TOTP):**
```json
{"action":"gpio", "pin":4, "level":1, "totp":123456}
```

Heimdall will publish a confirmation back to the **Status** topic (`/s`):
```json
{"action":"gpio", "pin":4, "level":1, "status":"ok"}
```

---

### ✦ TOTP Setup (HARDENED only)

When TOTP is enabled, every wake command must append a valid 6-digit time-based code to the target MAC address:

```text
AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF:123456
```

The TOTP seed is generated during provisioning and shown **once** on the portal secrets page as a Base32 value plus an `otpauth://` URI. Save it immediately. If it is lost, factory reset and reprovision the device to generate a new seed.

Any RFC 6238-compatible authenticator app or trigger script can generate codes from that seed.

---

### ✦ Status LED Patterns

Heimdall provides real-time visual feedback using the ESP32's built-in LED (GPIO2) out of the box. You also have the option to wire an external LED to a custom pin, or disable the LED completely in the configuration for stealth deployments.

> [!NOTE]
> The status LED is **fully disabled** in the **Hardened Stealth** preset (`CONFIG_WOL_STATUS_LED=n`). The device shows no visual activity in any state.

| State | LED Pattern | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Portal Mode** | Fast Blink (~2.5Hz) | Waiting for you to connect to the Heimdall WiFi setup portal |
| **Connecting** | Slow Pulse (~0.5Hz) | Attempting to connect to WiFi and the MQTT broker |
| **Ready** | Solid ON | Connected and actively listening for wake commands |
| **Wake Sent** | 6 Rapid Flashes (50ms) | Magic packet dispatched — returns to Ready automatically |

---

## ✦ Over-The-Air (OTA) Updates

Heimdall uses a dual-slot OTA partition table with automatic rollback. If the new firmware crashes on boot or fails to reach the MQTT broker, the bootloader automatically reverts to the previous working slot.

> [!NOTE]
> **The firmware-side OTA receiver task is not yet implemented.** The device cannot yet accept wireless firmware pushes over the network. The companion `scripts/ota_push.sh` helper (which uses `espota.py` on TCP port 3232) is already included for when the receiver is added in a future release. For now, use one of the following methods to update the firmware:
>
> - **[Web Flasher](https://ss-sauron.github.io/Heimdall-Wake-On-Lan-ESP32/)** — Flash directly from your browser over USB. No tools required.
> - **`idf.py flash`** — Rebuild from source and flash over USB with the ESP-IDF toolchain.

The rollback guarantee is already active: once the new firmware successfully connects to your MQTT broker, it calls `esp_ota_mark_app_valid_cancel_rollback()` to permanently commit the update.

---

## ✦ Factory Reset

To wipe stored credentials and return to provisioning mode:

1. Hold the **BOOT** button for 5 seconds.
2. Wait for the factory reset confirmation in the serial monitor.
3. The device erases the `wol` NVS namespace and reboots into the captive portal.

This works during normal relay operation and after provisioning mistakes.

## ✦ CI/CD Pipeline

Every push to `main` triggers an automated GitHub Actions workflow that:

- **Builds** STANDARD, HARDENED, and HARDENED STEALTH firmware profiles in parallel using the official Espressif ESP-IDF Docker image.
- **Deploys** the Web Flasher to GitHub Pages, bundling the freshly compiled `.bin` files alongside the flasher UI so users can always flash the latest code from their browser.

Every Git tag (`v1.0.0`) additionally:

- **Creates a GitHub Release** and attaches the compiled `heimdall-standard.bin`, `heimdall-hardened.bin`, and `heimdall-hardened-stealth.bin` as downloadable artifacts.
