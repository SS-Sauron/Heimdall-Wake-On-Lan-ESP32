<div align="center">

A compact **ESP32** firmware that stands silent watch on your MQTT broker, intercepts wake commands, and broadcasts **Wake-on-LAN magic packets** to sleeping machines on your local network.

Configure it once through the built-in captive portal — then forget it exists. Until you need it.

## ✦ What It Does

```
  [ MQTT Broker ] ──── TLS ────► [ Heimdall / ESP32 ] ──── UDP ────► [ Sleeping PC ]
                                         👁
                                    Always Watching
```

You send a command. Heimdall wakes your machine. That's it.

## ✦ Features

| | Feature |
|---|---|
| 🌐 | **Captive Portal Provisioning** — Connect, configure, done. Full DNS redirect on iOS, Android & Windows |
| 🔐 | **Two Build Profiles** — STANDARD for simplicity, HARDENED for OPSEC-grade deployments |
| 🔑 | **TOTP Authentication** — RFC 6238 compliant. Every wake command requires a valid one-time code |
| 🕵️ | **Identity Obfuscation** — MAC spoofing, fake consumer-device hostname, HMAC-derived opaque MQTT topics |
| 📡 | **Dynamic Broadcast** — Computes the correct broadcast address at runtime. Works on any subnet |
| 🔄 | **OTA Updates** — Pull firmware over HTTPS with automatic rollback on failure |
| 🛡️ | **Self-Healing** — Crash loop detection, wrong-credential recovery, WiFi timeout escape hatch |
| 🏷️ | **Custom Hostname** — Set your own device name, synced to DHCP, mDNS, and NetBIOS |

## ✦ Hardware

- **ESP32** (classic) development board
- Connected to your local WiFi network
- Access to an MQTT broker (local or cloud, port 1883 or 8883 TLS)

That's it. No extra components required.

---

## ✦ Quick Start

**1. Flash the firmware**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SS-Sauron/Heimdall.git
cd Heimdall
idf.py build flash monitor
```

**2. Connect to the portal**

On first boot, Heimdall creates a WiFi access point. Connect to it — your device will automatically open the configuration page. Enter your WiFi and MQTT broker credentials.

  <img src="resources/Portal.png" alt="Heimdall Captive Portal Configuration" width="400"/>
</div>

**3. Send a wake command**

Publish a payload to Heimdall's command topic:
```text
AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
```

Your machine wakes up.

## ✦ Example Boot Sequence

```console
I (645) main: Not provisioned — starting captive portal
I (660) portal: Portal AP  SSID: NETGEAR-XXXXXX
I (663) portal: Portal AP  PASS: <HIDDEN>  (write this on a label)
I (1109) portal: SoftAP started  SSID: NETGEAR-XXXXXX  Auth: WPA2  DHCP opt-114: http://192.168.4.1/
I (1117) dns_server: Listening on UDP port 53 — redirect → 192.168.4.1
I (1122) dns_server: Started — redirecting all A queries to 192.168.4.1
I (1135) portal: HTTP server ready on port 80
I (1135) portal: Portal ready — waiting for credentials
I (10709) esp_netif_lwip: DHCP server assigned IP to a client, IP is: 192.168.4.2
I (123605) portal: Stripped scheme prefix from broker URL: 'https://xxx.eu.hivemq.cloud' → 'xxx.eu.hivemq.cloud'
I (123618) storage: Credentials saved successfully
I (123619) storage: Hostname saved: test-relay-name
I (137113) portal: Credentials saved — rebooting into relay mode
```

## ✦ Response Payload

After dispatching a magic packet, Heimdall publishes a confirmation to the response topic:

```json
{
  "mac": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",
  "status": "sent",
  "free_heap": 187432,
  "uptime_s": 3672
}
