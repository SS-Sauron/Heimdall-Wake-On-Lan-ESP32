<div align="center">

A compact **ESP32** firmware that stands silent watch on your MQTT broker, intercepts wake commands, and broadcasts **Wake-on-LAN magic packets** to sleeping machines on your local network.

Configure it once through the built-in captive portal — then forget it exists. Until you need it.

</div>

## ✦ What It Does

```
  [ MQTT Broker ] ──── TLS ────► [ Heimdall / ESP32 ] ──── UDP ────► [ Sleeping PC ]
                                         👁
                                    Always Watching
```

You send a command. Heimdall wakes your machine. That's it.

## ✦ Hardware

- **ESP32** (classic) development board
- Connected to your local WiFi network
- Access to an MQTT broker (local or cloud, port 1883 or 8883 TLS)

That's it. No extra components required.

---

## ✦ Prerequisites

Before building, make sure the ESP-IDF environment is installed and exported in your shell.

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/) | v6.0.1 | Use the official installer or `install.sh` flow |
| Python | 3.8+ | Installed by the ESP-IDF tools setup |
| Xtensa ESP32 toolchain | ESP-IDF managed | Installed by `install.sh` / the ESP-IDF installer |
| IDF Component Manager | ESP-IDF bundled | Resolves managed components during build |

Check the active environment with:

```bash
idf.py --version
```

---

## ✦ Quick Start

**1. Clone the project**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SS-Sauron/Heimdall.git
cd Heimdall
idf.py set-target esp32
```

**2. Select a build profile (optional)**

The default profile is STANDARD. To switch to HARDENED before building:

```bash
idf.py menuconfig
```

Navigate to **WoL Relay → Build Profile**, choose the profile, save, and exit.

**3. Build, flash, and monitor**

```bash
idf.py build flash monitor
```

**4. Connect to the portal**

On first boot, Heimdall creates a WiFi access point. The SSID and password are printed to the serial monitor. Connect from your phone or laptop — the configuration page opens automatically on iOS, Android, and Windows. Enter your WiFi credentials and MQTT broker details.

<div align="center">
  <img src="resources/Portal.png" alt="Heimdall Captive Portal Configuration" width="400"/>
</div>

After saving, the device reboots into relay mode. Use the successful startup log below to confirm WiFi, TLS, and MQTT are all working.

**5. Send a wake command**

Publish the target machine's MAC address as a plain-text payload to Heimdall's command topic:

```text
AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
```

Your machine wakes up.

Publish a different target MAC to the same command topic to wake a different WoL-capable device on the same LAN. Heimdall does not store a single target PC MAC; the payload selects the target for each command.

> In HARDENED builds with TOTP enabled, the payload must include a valid time-based code. See [TOTP Setup](#-totp-setup-hardened-only).

---

## ✦ MQTT Broker

Heimdall works with hosted or local MQTT brokers. Use port `8883` for MQTT over TLS, or port `1883` for plain MQTT on a trusted local network.

Example hosted brokers include [HiveMQ Cloud](https://www.hivemq.com/mqtt-cloud-broker/) and [Adafruit IO](https://io.adafruit.com). These are examples only; any compatible MQTT broker should work.

In the portal, enter the broker hostname such as:

```text
example-cluster.s1.eu.hivemq.cloud
```

Do not include credentials, paths, or real secrets in the broker field. Scheme prefixes such as `mqtts://`, `mqtt://`, `https://`, and `tcp://` are accepted but stripped before storage.

---

## ✦ First Provisioning Boot

```console
I (645) main: Not provisioned — starting captive portal
I (660) portal: Portal AP  SSID: NETGEAR-XXXXXX
I (663) portal: Portal AP  PASS: <HIDDEN>  (write this on a label)
I (1109) portal: SoftAP started  SSID: NETGEAR-XXXXXX  Auth: WPA2  DHCP opt-114: http://192.168.4.1/
I (1117) dns_server: Listening on UDP port 53 — redirect → 192.168.4.1
I (1122) dns_server: Started — redirecting all A queries to 192.168.4.1
I (1135) portal: HTTP server ready on port 80
I (1135) portal: Portal ready — waiting for credentials
I (10709) esp_netif_lwip: DHCP server assigned IP to a client, IP is: 192.168.4.2
I (123605) portal: Stripped scheme prefix from broker URL: 'https://xxx.eu.hivemq.cloud' → 'xxx.eu.hivemq.cloud'
I (123618) storage: Credentials saved successfully
I (123619) storage: Hostname saved: test-relay-name
I (137113) portal: Credentials saved — rebooting into relay mode
```

---

## ✦ Successful Relay Startup

After provisioning valid WiFi and MQTT credentials, the next reboot should move past the portal and into relay mode. The important success markers are: WiFi gets an IP address, TLS validates the broker certificate, MQTT connects, and the command topic subscription is confirmed.

<div align="center">
  <img src="resources/relay-start.jpeg" alt="Heimdall relay startup confirmation screen" width="360"/>
</div>

```console
I (646) identity: Hostname loaded from NVS: test-relay
I (649) main: Credentials found — starting relay
I (2875) wifi_sta: Got IP: <local-ip>
I (2876) main: WiFi connected
I (2879) main: Starting MQTT relay
I (2881) opsec: Command  topic: wol/<device-mac>
I (2885) opsec: Response topic: wol/<device-mac>/r
I (2893) mqtt_relay: Connecting to MQTT broker: mqtts://<cluster>.hivemq.cloud:8883
I (2900) mqtt_relay: MQTT credential lengths: username=<len> password=<len>
I (2906) mqtt_relay: TLS hostname verification/SNI: enabled via broker URI hostname
I (2917) mqtt_relay: MQTT client started — relay is active
I (3702) esp-x509-crt-bundle: Certificate validated
I (4895) mqtt_relay: MQTT connected — subscribing to: wol/<device-mac>
I (5002) mqtt_relay: Subscription confirmed (msg_id=22951)
```

If the log reaches `MQTT connected` and `Subscription confirmed`, Heimdall is online and waiting for wake commands on the command topic shown above.

## ✦ Finding Your Command Topic

The topic Heimdall subscribes to depends on the selected build profile.

**STANDARD build**

```text
Command:  wol/<device-mac>
Response: wol/<device-mac>/r
```

`<device-mac>` is the ESP32 station MAC printed in the serial monitor. Do not use the target PC's MAC in the topic; the target PC's MAC goes in the payload.

Because the target MAC is payload-driven, one Heimdall relay can wake multiple WoL-capable machines on the same LAN broadcast domain. Send the same command topic with a different target MAC for each machine.

**HARDENED build**

```text
Command:  <16-character-hmac-topic>
Response: <16-character-hmac-response-topic>
```

HARDENED topics are derived from the device MAC and a secret generated during provisioning. They are printed to the serial monitor during relay startup and should be copied into your trigger script.

---

## ✦ Response Payload

After dispatching a magic packet, Heimdall publishes a confirmation to the response topic:

```json
{
  "mac": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",
  "status": "sent",
  "free_heap": 187432,
  "uptime_s": 3672
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `mac` | The target MAC address that the Wake-on-LAN magic packet was dispatched to. |
| `status` | Confirmation that the packet was successfully broadcast to the local network. |
| `free_heap` | The available RAM on the ESP32 in bytes. Useful for monitoring device health. |
| `uptime_s` | Total time the ESP32 has been continuously running in seconds since the last reboot. |

---

## ✦ TOTP Setup (HARDENED only)

When TOTP is enabled, every wake command must append a valid 6-digit time-based code to the target MAC address:

```text
AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF:123456
```

The TOTP seed is generated during provisioning and shown once on the portal secrets page as a Base32 value plus an `otpauth://` URI. Save it immediately; it is not printed again. If it is lost, factory reset and reprovision the device to generate a new seed.

Any RFC 6238-compatible authenticator app or trigger script can generate codes from that seed. See [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) for the full hardened-mode and payload details.

---

## ✦ Factory Reset

To wipe stored credentials and return to provisioning mode:

1. Hold the **BOOT** button for 5 seconds.
2. Wait for the factory reset confirmation in the serial monitor.
3. The device erases the `wol` NVS namespace and reboots into the captive portal.

This works during normal relay operation and after provisioning mistakes.
